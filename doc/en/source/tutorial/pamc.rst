This tutorial uses reference files, ``template.txt`` and ``experiment.txt``,
which are the same as the previous tutorial (:doc:`minsearch`) uses.

This subsection describes the input file.
For details, see :ref:`the manual of bayes <bayes_input>`.

In the following, we will briefly describe this input file.
For details, see the manual of :doc:`../algorithm/exchange`.

- The ``[base]`` section describes the settings for a whole calculation.

    - ``dimension`` is the number of variables you want to optimize. In this case, specify ``2`` because it optimizes two variables.

- The ``[solver]`` section specifies the solver to use inside the main program and its settings.

    - See the minsearch tutorial.

- The ``[algorithm]`` section sets the algorithm to use and its settings.

    - ``name`` is the name of the algorithm you want to use, and in this tutorial we will use RXMC, so specify ``exchange``.

    - ``label_list`` is a list of label names to be given when outputting the value of ``value_0x`` (x = 1,2).

    - ``seed`` is the seed that a pseudo-random number generator uses.

    - The ``[algorithm.param]`` section sets the parameter space to be explored.

        - ``min_list`` is a lower bound and ``max_list`` is an upper bound.
        - ``unit_list`` is step length in one MC update (deviation of Gaussian)

    - The ``[algorithm.pamc]`` section sets the parameters for PAMC.

        - ``numsteps_annealing`` is the number of interval steps between temperature decreasing.

        - ``bmin``, ``bmax`` are the minimum and the maximum of inversed temperature, respectively.

        - ``Tnum`` is the number of (inversed) temperature points.

        - When ``Tlogspace`` is ``true``, the temperature points are distributed uniformly in the logarithmic space.

        - ``nreplica_per_proc`` is the number of replicas (MC walkers) in one MPI process.

- The ``[solver]`` section specifies the solver to use inside the main program and its settings.

    - See the :doc:`minsearch` tutorial.


Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, move to the folder where the sample file is located (hereinafter, it is assumed that you are the root directory of 2DMAT).

.. code-block::

    cd sample/sim-trhepd-rheed/pamc

Copy ``bulk.exe`` and ``surf.exe`` as the tutorial for the direct problem.

.. code-block::

    cp ../../../../sim-trhepd-rheed/src/TRHEPD/bulk.exe .
    cp ../../../../sim-trhepd-rheed/src/TRHEPD/surf.exe .

Execute ``bulk.exe`` to generate ``bulkP.b`` .

.. code-block::

    ./bulk.exe

Then, run the main program (it takes a few secondes)

.. code-block::

    mpiexec -np 4 python3 ../../../src/py2dmat_main.py input.toml | tee log.txt


Here, the calculation is performed using MPI parallel with 4 processes.
(If you are using Open MPI and you request more processes than you can use, add the ``--oversubscribed`` option to the ``mpiexec`` command.)

When executed, a folder for each rank will be created, and ``trial_TXXX.txt`` files containing the parameters evaluated in each Monte Carlo step and the value of the objective function at each temperature (``XXX`` is the index of points), and ``result_TXXX.txt`` files containing the parameters actually adopted will be created.
These files are concatnated into ``result.txt`` and ``trial.txt``.

These files have the same format: the first two columns are time (step) and the index of walker in the process, the third is the (inversed) temperature, the fourth column is the value of the objective function, and the fifth and subsequent columns are the parameters.
The final two columns are the weight of walker (Neal-Jarzynski weight) and the index of the grand ancestor (the replica index at the beginning of the calculation).

.. code-block::

  # step walker beta fx z1 z2 weight ancestor
  0 0 0.0 0.07702743614780189 5.788848278451443 3.949126663745358 1.0 0
  0 1 0.0 0.08737730661436376 3.551756435031283 3.6136808356591192 1.0 1
  0 2 0.0 0.04954470587051104 4.70317508724506 4.786634108937754 1.0 2
  0 3 0.0 0.04671675601156148 5.893543559206865 4.959531290614713 1.0 3
  0 4 0.0 0.04142014655238446 5.246719912601735 4.960709612555206 1.0 4


In the case of the sim-trhepd-rheed solver, a subfolder ``Log%%%%%`` (``%%%%%`` is the number of MC steps) is created under each working folder, and locking curve information etc. are recorded.

Finally, ``best_result.txt`` is filled with information about the parameter with the optimal objective function (R-factor), the rank from which it was obtained, and the Monte Carlo step.

.. code-block::

  nprocs = 4
  rank = 0
  step = 71
  walker = 5
  fx = 0.008186713312593607
  z1 = 4.225633749839847
  z2 = 5.142666117413409

Finally, ``fx.txt`` stores the statistics at each temperature point:

.. code-block::

  # $1: 1/T
  # $2: mean of f(x)
  # $3: standard error of f(x)
  # $4: number of replicas
  # $5: log(Z/Z0)
  # $6: acceptance ratio
  0.0 0.06428002079611472 0.002703413400677839 40 0.0 0.795
  10.0 0.061399304916174735 0.002649424392996749 40 -0.6280819199879947 0.85
  20.0 0.05904248889111052 0.0031622711212952034 40 -1.2283060742855603 0.74
  30.0 0.04956921148431115 0.0028298565759159633 40 -1.7991035905899855 0.67

The first column is (inversed) temperature, and
the second/third ones are the mean and standard error of :math:`f(x)`, respectively.
The fourth column is the number of replicas and the fifth one is the logarithm of the ratio of the partition functions, :math:`\log(Z_n/Z_0)`, where :math:`Z_0` is the partition function at the first temperature.
The sixth column is the acceptance ratio of MC updates.

In addition, ``do.sh`` is prepared as a script for batch calculation.
``do.sh`` also checks the difference between ``best_result.txt`` and ``ref.txt``.
I will omit the explanation below, but I will post the contents.

.. code-block::

  sh prepare.sh

  ./bulk.exe

  time mpiexec --oversubscribe -np 4 python3 ../../../src/py2dmat_main.py input.toml

  echo diff output/fx.txt ref.txt
  res=0
  diff output/fx.txt ref.txt || res=$?
  if [ $res -eq 0 ]; then
    echo TEST PASS
    true
  else
    echo TEST FAILED: output/fx.txt and ref.txt differ
    false
  fi

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By illustrating ``result_T.txt``, you can estimate regions where the parameters with small R-factor are.
In this case, the figure ``result_fx.pdf`` and ``result_T.pdf`` of the 2D parameter space is created by using the following command.
The color of symbols of ``result_fx.pdf`` and ``result_T.pdf`` mean ``R-factor`` and :math:`\beta`, respectively.

.. code-block::

    python3 plot_result_2d.py

Looking at the resulting diagram, we can see that the samples are concentrated near (5.25, 4.25) and (4.25, 5.25), and that the ``R-factor`` value is small there.


.. figure:: ../../../common/img/pamc_fx.*

    Sampled parameters and ``R-factor``. The horizontal axes is ``value_01``  and the vertical axes is ``value_02`` .

.. figure:: ../../../common/img/pamc_T.*

    Sampled parameters and :math:`\beta`. The horizontal axes is ``value_01``  and the vertical axes is ``value_02`` .

Also, ``RockingCurve.txt`` is stored in each subfolder,
``LogXXX_YYY`` (``XXX`` is an index of MC step and ``YYY`` is an index of a replica in the MPI process).
By using this, it is possible to compare with the experimental value according to the procedure of the previous tutorial.
